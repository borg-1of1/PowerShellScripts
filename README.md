# PowerShellScripts
This is a repository for various PowerShell scripts that I have written or modified over the years.  These I have found to be useful for specific jobs or functions that were repetative in nature.  Rather than go looking for the command to run each time, I felt that it was more apprpriate to script it a.k.a. the lazy sys admin approach.  Anyway, if you find something here that is useful or you have suggestions, please feel free to create your own clone and send me any changes.  The bueaty of doing things on the Internet like this is that it can be collaborative and it can bring really smart and passionate people together to make technology do the things we need it to do.
## Branches
The code will be organized into branches to make it somewhat easier to find based on root level of what the code is intended to do.  For example, all code that is related to either generating checksums or hashes or verifying those will be in the hashes branch.  There may be sub-branches within those branches while specific functionality is being worked. Once done, that will be merged back into the root of that branch.
